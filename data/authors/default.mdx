Brett Stockmeier is a computer science professional. His values include activism, community, family and teamwork. His hobbies include running Dungeons & Dragons, anime, comics, boxing, pinball and video games. Someday he would like to learn an instrument (piano). (His avatar is his D&D character)

He has multiple years of professional programming experience, but due to market conditions finds himself on the job hunt again. In his free time he has started this blog to keep and further refine his programming skills while giving him a place to write about whatever he wants. He's also got some nifty app ideas he'd love to tell you about.
