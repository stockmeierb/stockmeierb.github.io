1. I read some of the previous issues on the current JSA series. It was terrible and off-putting. It should be illeagal to advertise on the cover that you're looking at part 1 of a new story, only to list the book as being part **11** in an ongoing story on the inside. Maybe I'll stick with the book once Year 1 ends, long enough to see if I can get into what it's got going on. In all liklihood the book will be canceled soon enough anyway
1. My boss's favorite book is a 90's run called *Starman*. Someone I now realize is a golden age hero. The book itself is about his son taking over his mantle and doing things his own way. The story and character writing is extremely competent, but the art is this gorgeous fusion of like Bruce Timm Batman TAS Gotham shadows in a shining opalescent contemporary 90's city that feels timeless and fresh all at the same time. Like the World's fair in the 90s. I'm enjoying it. Feels like a time capsule, but I don't know if it's emblematic of comics at the time. It feels more like a hidden gem in the mud that was that decade of comics? Maybe. The 90's are actually a gigantic blind spot for me.
1. Sandman Mystery Theater. It's a thing. For some reason I thought it was an anthology series, but it's actually a period comic about the original Sandman character. The mystery man with the knockout gas and the sometimes prophetic dreams. It's now on my list, as I think it might give me more of what I want from JSA Year 1.

The End.
