Quick Rundown of the DC Compact Comics I've read so far (coming from someone who has read a lot more Marvel than DC):

Wonder Woman: Earth One - Really weird. They advertise it like it's a straight up hero story, but in actuality this might be the closest to WW's "Evil Superman" story. Her "Red Son" story where she pushes her ideology just a bit over the line into authoritarian fascism (eventually; and those words might be a tad... strong). That's not gonna resonate with everyone. But on the plus side, every woman is drawn and celebrated like a gorgeous pin-up?

Harley Quinn & the Gotham City Sirens - This was fun enough, but it felt like it should be longer? And I guess it's really only like the first half of the run. The last arc didn't feel like a climax to everything I'd read thus far, but there were some good stories in here. Great art too if you are buying this to look at the beautiful pseudo-villain ladies (no judgement). If they made a follow-up with the back half of the series, I'd pick it up for sure.

Batman: Hush & Court of Owls Saga - I like Batman fine, but he's pushed so hard that it turns me off and I usually resist the urge to get caught up in anything that isn't self-contained. So a story ripped from the comics (like Hush, and Court of Owls) is new to me next to something like Killing Joke and Dark Knight Returns. And I liked them both fine. I question if I really remember or understand Hush right, but I appreciated the spotlight on so many villains. Court of Owls I also don't remember all the details too. It was still a fun read going into the history of the Wayne family and Gotham City itself. 

I think I'd personally rate Hush a bit higher, but there's no reason not to read both if you're a fan or curious. And in my judgement, only minimal prior knowledge is needed (they are fairly accessible) and offer good reason to return

All-Star Superman - As a Superman fan, it's probably blasphemy to say All-Star isn't my favorite. It's great, but not my favorite, and I think if it's the first Superman book you read, you're not going to see why exactly Superman fans love it so much. It's the story of Superman's bucket list. A celebration victory lap for the character aimed at fans, not new readers. Personally, I like For All Seasons (being his "Year One") for that. And admittedly, while I like his work here better than New X-Men, Frank Quitely just isn't my favorite artist

Superman: Birthright - A perfectly fine (although not the best; again, see For All Seasons) Superman origin retelling. The recent movie pulls some material from it, and that makes it all the easier to recommend. It's not my favorite art, and it's a bit slow to get going, but on the plus side it also has one of my favorite Lois Lane moments in anything.

Far Sector - I liked this way better than I expected. I don't know that much about Green Lanterns, except "Space Cops", and this is definitely a story about space cops. It's a traditional hardboiled detective story about the new space cop in town tasked with solving a murder and bringing order to space New York, and having to deal with all its myriad minority sub-cultures that don't feel like direct analogues to anything irl (One of the 3 major species are cyber people in a virtual space who survive on memes?), but it's unquestionably (and unapologetically) political, to the point of putting civil rights quotes in the issues. It's not the kind of story where you're gonna pick up everything on the first read, but it's also something I could see myself reading again someday. The art is too nice for the DC Compact Comic format.

On Deck (Bought, but not read): Catwoman: Trail of the Catwoman, Wonder Woman: Blood and Guts, DC: The New Frontier, Watchmen (but come on, it's Watchmen), Harley Quinn: Wild at Heart
