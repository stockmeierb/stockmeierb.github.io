# Introduction

Allow me to get something, perhaps my biggest critique of the series off my chest before I begin: Tylor doesn't have an ending. It's composed of a 26 epsisode tv series and a 10 episode OVA sequel, and that OVA ends in a real awkward spot. It felt like they were gearing up for one final OVA episode (or even a movie) and it doesn't seem to exist. Instead it just stops.

You can be *extremely* generous and say that nothing more needs to be shown. That you've kicked a rock down a hill and nobody actually *needs* to watch it tumble to know where and how it will come to rest at the bottom. But this isn't *North By Northwest*. I imagine that if you're really into the show by the end, you'll deeply miss not getting to see the inevitable climax.

This is a huge strike for me. It's rare that I embrace anything fiction that doesn't finish telling its story. (Only example I can think of right now is Bubblegum Crisis, which I loved even before I knew Crash was a thing)

All that said...

I watched Irresponsible Captain Tylor (IRC). The whole thing is posted sub and dub on youtube via the publisher's official channel (note: the OVA wasn't dubbed, but those episodes are included in the sub playlist). I'd heard good things about the dub, so I actually jumped around experiencing both. My feelings on the series as a whole aside, I can concede it's a very good dub for its time, and they even went the extra mile of recording an english cover of the opening. 

# Story/Characters

Combining these because I don't know that there's that much to say about either one.

#### Story

On a larger scale, the story is about an intergalactic war between the burgeoning human federation and the holy Raalgon empire. There's seemingly bad faith actors on both sides pushing for the war, and it has all the makings of an intergalactic quagmire.

Enter Tylor, a 20 year old slacker and possible hobo, who sees a military recruitment advertisement, jumps to the conclusion that it would be the key to an easy life, signs up and proceeds to blunder his way to success.

Before going any further, I'd like to epmhasize something: I like stories of underdogs thinking outside of the box, upending the status quo with their brand new unnorthodox perspective and finding sucess while uppending the status quo and teaching the old guard a new trick or two.

# Random Thoughts 
(Some spoilers here; none of it plot related)

- This show feels like it was being written during production. The characters bounce around the globe in a series of disconnected arcs, almost never actually driving the plot. When the main cast find themselves in the action, it always feels like its either someone else's will, luck, or an accident.

- There are a lot of unanswered questions that it feels like they just want you to froget about. I could list example here, but it would be too tempting to spoil something, and there's so precious little to spoil here I genuinely wouldn't want to, with one early exception: why Team rocket even wants the Blue Water in the first place (They claim they saw it... adverised on a poster?)

- This series might be a prequeel to Evangelion? At one point there's a humanoid giant (named "Adam") that's supposed to be a proto-human. (Also a lot of barriers = AT Fields?) It's not really relevant (to either Nadia the show or Evangelion), but if not a direct prequel it's definitely a rough draft/prototype for the kinds of ~~themes~~ lore that would be recycled for Eva later on 

- There's a "10 years after" epilogue in the final episode. I won't spoil anything, except that one of the pairings is gross and fairly out of left field. If you were hoping for this, you're a creep.

- The show has a certain style about it. The animation and character designs pop. The music is poppy and energetic (if not always ambitious or memrable)

- They did a whole episode of character songs/AMVs once. That was kinda fun

- Apparently it has a [pretty laughably(?) bad english dub](https://youtu.be/6lefduazQQA?si=PPihoOSjwPdq1I-x). I had never heard it until just a few minutes ago. 

- The whole series takes place in the late 1800's. That's probably worth mentioning.

# In Conclusion

I don't actually like being negative, but I can't really recommend this. It's not awful when you understand what you're getting into, and indeed there's a lot here that I enjoyed. But not enough, and it's also a larger commitment than a typical 26 episode series. Even when you accept that the "filler" is the point, it's still pretty poorly paced. In fact, I'd probably rate it somewhere around St. Tail (a series I've reviewed prior to starting this blog; I'll probably post it retroactively at some point)

Even when it's applicable that you (or your kids) are in the relevant mood/mindset for a coming-of-age story, you have better options. (Castle in the Sky comes to mind, as does Escaflowne).

The only reason I can charitably support for watching this series is to experience the complete filmography of Hideaki Anno, and at least then I'm happy to say you'll get some Evangelion connections (or at least one) for your trouble.

Everyone else... have you considered watching Castle in the Sky, Escaflowne, or even Gunbuster instead?
