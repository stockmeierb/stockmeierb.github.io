I watched Golden Boy. I'm not sure why, so let me go on a tangent...
I think for a lot of these, I'm watching things based on two criteria: Have I seen it already? Do I vaguely remember hearing the name of the show before?
Notably absent: "have I heard that the show is actually good?" I might need to be more discriminating in the future...
But none of that is to say Golden Boy is necessarily bad. Like everything, it matters most who you are and what you're expecting going into it. As to whether Golden Boy is good... there's clearly effort behind the production. But I wonder if I've ever heard anyone say it's actually good so much as I've heard them say it's unique. Not the same thing at all.
For a quick litmus test on whether this show is for you; go to your preferred gif library and type in Golden Boy. Does the top result seem like something you'd like to see more of?
Golden Boy is only 6 episodes, and that's probably the only reason I finished it. It wasn't kryptonite for me or anything, but just very much not my bag. It reminded me a little bit of Captain Tylor.
The protagonist is an eternal student, riding his bike around to take different part time jobs and soak in different experiences. To its credit, not every episode follows the same pattern, but it's not uncommon to see him encounter a beautiful woman, be an absolute sex pest (he's got a thing for toilets in particular), master whatever challenge is presented to him, and leave the girl thoroughly seduced as he hits the road.
There's not much else to say. It's only 6 episodes. They don't all follow that pattern exactly. The animation is pretty good throughout, but the fan-service is pretty bad. (The women are basically drawn naked and only have clothes painted on at the very end).
'nuff said honestly.
Currently I'm in the middle of Dunbine (enjoying it quite a bit), and winding up another season of Ranma,
I'm considering working in the first arc of One Piece (abridged pacing; I'll watch until I feel I've seen enough or I come to good stopping point) and Dirty Pair next.
Dirty Pair is actually good, right? It's not another Golden Boy situation?
