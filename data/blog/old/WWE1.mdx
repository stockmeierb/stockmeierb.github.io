## Girl Power?

I finally got around to finishing the Wonder Woman Earth One compact comic I picked up a while ago. I wish I could say it only took me so long to read it b/c I was procrastinating, but that would be a lie.

Took me a while to sort out my feelings on the story. I thought E1 was supposed to be beginner friendly modern retellings, akin to the Marvel Ultimate universe (the first one). Reading it with those expectations left me vaguely unsettled and confused.

But now, whether its intentional or not, I've come to view it as the WW equivalent of Superman Red Son: A twist on the traditional origin (what the twist is exactly, don't ask me) that shows WW being ever so slightly pushed off the path of "hero" to instead become an authoritarian (but loving) tyrant. Still WW, but a version of the character that takes her philosophy (or a very specific version of her philosophy) several steps too far.

I'm not sure how or why they thought this story should be E1. I'm not sure why they thought it would be a good candidate for the first run for the compact comics.

At the very least, I can say the art is absolutely gorgeous. It's also super kinky. I understand this falls nicely in line with the character's origins.

It's sadly not something I would recommend without first setting proper expectations. (Hopefully I've done that here)
