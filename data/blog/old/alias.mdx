## So I used to write a lot of these...

First review post! Copied verbatim from something I wrote elsewhere! I thought it was better/longer than it was! Might have to revisit the series eventually.

You like Jessica Jones on ~~Netflix~~ Disney+. That first season at least I bet. Everything after that was pretty meh. I thought it ended on a positive note anyway. (That's something to know about me: I'm not actually a very tough critic)

Back to the point: consider reading the comics that inspired the whole thing:
[Alias](https://www.amazon.com/Jessica-Jones-Alias-Vol-2001-2003-ebook/dp/B013TXA1N0/ref=sr_1_2?crid=LXHIKWXS5Z4D&keywords=Alias&qid=1649645109&s=comics-manga&sprefix=alias%2Ccomics-manga%2C107&sr=1-2)

This actually moves away from the Netflix show pretty quickly. Jessica reads almost like a completely different character, and only the very last arc introduces the Purple Man. Everything before that is just a series of hard-boiled detective cases exploring the seedier side of Marvel's super-hero universe. Very stand-alone. So dark and gritty they had to publish it under Marvel's "MAX" line of comics with an explicit content warning.

I actually love it. So much of comics is devoted to brief deviations and returns to the status quo, and adhering to a certain code of ethics within the big 2, and this series/line was dedicated to pushing what was expected... at least for a little while. But for real, it's weird to see her track down that weird Spider-man extended family character Spider-girl and find out she's a total drug addict. Or that there's a Daredevil knock-off character called D-Man. Real obscure stuff that will win you a no-prize at your local bar trivia.

Not going to draw this out b/c I want to see if I embedded images right.
