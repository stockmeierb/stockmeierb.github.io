## What I did today:

- Watched a bunch of youtube videos to help familiarize myself with the IDE (see 2025 shopping list)
- replaced Banner on the readme with my LinkedIn banner (a temporary fix, but it will last for a while)
- Found out that the website wasn't updating because certain dependencies had been deprecated

## Dear Diary:

I'm quite pleased I managed to get this resolved today, and didn't actually just give up when it wasn't easy. (It was easy, but I didn't know that at a glance)

I performed an investigation into the github workflows and logging from the failed deployments and figured out the issue stemmed from certain dependencies located on the `gh_pages.yml` file.

This actually sent me into a minor panic. This is someone else's poorly maintained code as much as it is mine from years ago, and I couldn't be sure I would have a SME to guide me through the process of updating .yml dependencies. 

Turns out, they get downloaded and applied on build based on what's written in the file.

YAML files (called "charts"?) are basically a set of instructions for a pipeline. Dependencies referenced by them aren't housed in the project, but are rather downloaded and applied as it goes through the pipeline. 

TMYK!

Had a smaller, briefer scare when I saw another dependency was being deprecated (not dead yet though), but this one came from someone else's deploy script being used by the project. At first glance I thought the script was abandoned and I'd either have to learn what it does and come up with a replacement myself (would probably be good for me) or find another replacement.

But then I saw that the new version was available after all, and updating it fixed it fine.

Got to open and close an issue today!

Not a bad day. I'll take the win (any)where I can find it.
