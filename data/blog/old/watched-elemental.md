## Minimum Effort Today:

I sat down to watch Elemental with this animation club I found. It wasn't my pick, but whatever. It's a fun way to spend a saturday night when I've got nothing else going on.

Anyway, the point is, I (and you) wrote the movie off when it came out. It was marketed bad, it came out during peak covid, it had that annoying actress with the weird name who was just gd everywhere, and it just looked like same old same old from Pixar.

It's actually pretty good. They made it out to be a Romeo and Juliet story, but the real theme is about 2nd generation imigrant children and shit.

It is "same old same old" Pixar, but it's also good Pixar. Not sure if anyone here is still interested in that, but if you are, you should consider giving it a try
