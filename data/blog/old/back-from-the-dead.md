## It's easy to get frustrated and before you know it...

2 whole months have passed...

So when images didn't immediately display the way I thought they should, I got frustrated and walked away. My mistake. Back now, and the images... are displaying. So that's good. Not quite how I'd like though, so that is going to drive my next round of tutorials. Markdown images don't support a ton of html attributes though, so I'm going to be looking at giving it some css defined classes (probably not the right terminology; I haven't actually worked with css since I learned css)

Got a good lead on tailwind css, so that's what I'm looking at first. Maybe there will be something to write about in the experience afterwards.
