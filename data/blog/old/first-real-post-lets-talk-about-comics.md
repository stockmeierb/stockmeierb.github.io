## Welcome

I screwed around getting this blog up and running, but with any luck this will be the first real post with substance! My name is brett Stockmeier, and I am some kind of a programmer. I'm out of the habit of programming though, and so this website will be my playground: hopefully over time I'll be tinkering with it, refining it, and personalizing it. And then I'll write about my experiences here in this space.

But! It's hard to consistently generate tech content. And so I'll also be blogging about other things. Things I like. My hobbies. Comics for instance. It'll give me a chance to practice my markdown (a good idea for a tech post).

## But back to comics...

I've been reading them for a couple years now. It's not weird: comics are everywhere today. They may single-handedly be keeping the movie industry alive. But what started out as a curiosity born out of my nostalgia for the saturday morning cartoons I have such nostalgia for kinda ballooned out of control pretty quickly.

This can be attributed to one thing: Comixology. As a digital platform, it offered 2 distinct features: unprecedented selection, and regular sales at deep discounts. Combine these with the convenience of digital (no need to physically store the comics, read virtually anywhere on anything). It was a fertile platform that encouraged exploration, and I got to dive pretty deep and see what the medium truly had to offer beyond capes and spandex. And that's what I'm going to try and write about here. I don't hope to garner much of an audience: like I said, this is primarily about keeping this blog active with new content (and even better, new github commits).

Next up I just need to figure out how to add pictures. Til next time!

Ciao.

P.S. I know I was really hyping up Comixology, but recently Amazon practically destroyed it in a fit of misguided corporate greed and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that here. It's still an okay service, but it's not what it once was, and very likely no longer your best option.
