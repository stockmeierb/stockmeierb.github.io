## Didn't mean to disappear!

Here's some of what I've been up to, and thinking about:

I'm still learning TypeScript and in fact that's coming along nicely. I've reached the point where I have a grasp of all the fundamentals, and I'm now looking for ways to incorporate them into my projects, starting with this website.

I still can't figure out how to get my brother's logo off the tab display. It's very frustrating.

The job hunt is always teetering on the tip of being promising. I've got people referring me to their companies, but I still largely see nothing for my efforts but form email rejections. Something that was spelled out for me a while ago is that I sit right in a purgatory of being not quite senior level.

Something I'm amazed I've never heard before last week in all my time job searching is the idea that nowadays its a waste of time if you can't apply within the first 3 days after a job is posted. A week at most.

And yet I'm frustrated to see some companies posting and reposting jobs here on LinkedIn that link back to postings that are months old on their own jobs site.
