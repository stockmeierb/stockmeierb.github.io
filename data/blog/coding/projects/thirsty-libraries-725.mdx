# Overview

The name of this blog is something I actually thought up a long time ago. It was inspired by the fact that I was always a little... pushy when it came to telling the people around me about whatever I was reading (or watching, or listening to, or... anything really) at the moment. I decided to repurpose this name for the blog, and then again for my newest project idea.

Inspired by the Summer Reading Programs organized by my local public library I used to love participating in as a child, *Thirsty Libraries* (only a tenative/code name at the moment) is designed to replicate that experience as an application (either/both as a web application and/or mobile application).

## Goal

Create a program that replicates the experience of participating in a summer reading program at your local library

#### MVP

1. Create a page that will assign book genres to reading
1. Create a form that will allow users to report on books that have been reading
1. Create a status screen that will track progress through the program
1.  Make it pretty. Make it fun.

#### Ultimate form

Being an app/web app running 3-4 “seasons” a year, with a battle pass system where premium members get little tangible trinkets for completing goals (free versions get achievements, badges and digital rewards). Perhaps try to develop integration with websites like good reads. Maybe partner with libraries

## Components

#### MVP

- A randomizer that will generate genre pools for the player to choose their next book(s) from.

- A reporting form to enter your completed books
    - Fields to be listed below
      
- A progress tracker to show your status in the season

- A navigation system between the 3 screens

**Genre Pool:**
- Free Choice
- Scary
- Romance
- History
- Biography
- Non-Fiction
- Poetry
- Anthology
- Realistic Fiction
- Fantasy
- Science-Fiction
- Graphic Novel

**Reporting Fields:**
- tItle
- author
- genre
- format
- page count/listen time 

**Potential Themes:**
- Medieval
- Space
- Dinosaurs
- Pirates
- Sports
- TTRPG

**Note:** theme design ideally comes from independent artists (paid for their work, and credited)

# First Steps
- randomizer
    - Look into some premade modules or math functions that generate a random result and map those results to a list of book genres

- Reporting Form
    - Learn how to create a basic form that validates specific input

- Progress tracker
    - Look into creating/designing a database that can store user data and submitted book data from the reporting form

- Navigation
    - Lookup a simple navigation system

# Even More First Steps
- Decide whether to focus on web application or mobile app
