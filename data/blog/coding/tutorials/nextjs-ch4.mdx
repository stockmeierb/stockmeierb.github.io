# Introduction
This chapter was genuinely exciting and engaging. I learned a lot about how next.js components interact with each other and can "cascade" down the file system with nested layouts. Hopefully I can demonstrate what I learned below. It's obvious though this chapter had a lot of vital information that is going to be directly relevant to working on the most basic of projects in the future.

#### Goals of this chapter
1. Create the dashboard routes using file-system routing.
1. Understand the role of folders and files when creating new route segments.
1. Create a nested layout that can be shared between multiple dashboard pages.
1. Understand what colocation, partial rendering, and the root layout are.
 

## Nested routing
I have vague memories of in the past working with languages and technologies where routing needed to be made explicit with code written into the project. In this section Next.js introduces its own built in method for handling routing, and I am in love with the elegance of its simplicity.

Simply put, in Next.js, the file system informs the routing.

Every folder within a folder corresponds to a new segment of the url a user must navigate to in order to access that content. Is it possible to override or work around this default behavior? Perhaps. Maybe there will be more instruction on how to do just that later on. But for now, I am in awe of the relationship between the project structure and the application behavior. And how the one influences the other. It compels coders to think ahead when making naming and project structure decisions. It encourages *planning* and smart design.

And similarly, it may also encourage minimal/efficient design? When happhazardly adding files to the file structure can very directly affect the user experience in such a major way, I think I personally would have to second guess some of my decisions.

This also made me wonder almost immediately that Next.js is not immediately suitable for all types of projects. This blog for example is being built with Next.js and Tailwind. And I've been customizing it as I saw fit to help keep content sorted, including adding sub folders. This post for example lies in the `blog/coding/tutorials` folder. A folder for my coding stuff, and a sub folder for my reactions as I continue to go through the Next.js tutorials.

I didn't realize that my browser was hiding the url from me. Revealing the url of my past posts... I didn't realize how complex they had become. Of course, we are living in the future. Where things like urls and telephone numbers are largely abstracted away. With a minimum of effort, it's something you only need to imput once, and then you let your browser or your cell phone's built in address book remember it for you forever.

Or maybe I'm just the weird one worrying about how long my urls are and nobody else pays such things any mind.

Anyway, the chapter continues to say that to actually create the pages on these routes, you need to add a reserved file: `page.tsx`. Without this file, navigating to the route will only yield a 404. But regardless of whether you have `page.tsx` or not, the file structure will still inform the URL.
